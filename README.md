# Arcs Hub — Community Services App

Arcs Hub is a community-focused **web and mobile app** created using **Glide Apps** as part of a high school passion project.  
The platform is fully responsive and can be accessed on both smartphones and desktop browsers.

The goal of Arcs Hub is to support the local community by giving visibility to small businesses, home-based services, and informal service providers who may not have a platform to promote or advertise their work.

## 🌟 Purpose

This app was created as part of a high school passion project, with the goal of building something meaningful and helpful for the community.

Local businesses — including structured organizations, informal or unstructured providers, and home-based services that aren't widely advertised — are welcome to promote their services here.  
Arcs Hub makes local service discovery easier, more inclusive, and accessible to everyone on **any device**.

## 🛠️ How Arcs Hub Works

Arcs Hub is built using Glide and works seamlessly across devices. Users can browse services, submit listings, and explore categories with a clean, responsive interface.

### **1. Business owners add their services**
Service providers can submit:
- Service name  
- Category  
- Description  
- Contact information  
- Optional images  

Submissions are published immediately and become visible to the community.

### **2. Community members browse by category**
Users can:
- Choose a service category  
- View all services within that category  
- Open detailed service listings  
- Access contact details directly  

### **3. Simple, lightweight, and inclusive**
Being entirely built with **Glide Apps**, Arcs Hub benefits from:
- Automatic mobile + desktop responsiveness  
- A built-in database (Glide Tables or Sheets)  
- A clean, user-friendly interface  
- No-code logic for forms, filtering, and viewing
